# BATTLESHIP
Quick and dirty battleship game in ruby. 2 players take turns on the same console to sink each others ships. [battleship (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game))

## Improvements
- create server-clients socket connection in order to use separate consoles
- tidy up some of the code and console text layout
